My name is MiKayla Renee Pollard, and I was born November 5, 1998. I have two older brothers who are 27 and 31, so that makes me the only girl. I am a 17 year old high school senior attending Forest Hill High School in Jackson, Ms. I love to sing, cheer, and dance. I like to draw sometimes. Although I love many bright colors, my favorite color is pink. In the fall of 2017, I plan to attend Tougaloo College in Jackson, Ms.
